his mathematical art is cool because of its consistency and its always repeating patterns. You can create your own benice fractal spirograph with this amazing javascript. (As always, the whole project is available on github.com/framepatch)

The code is written in Javascript with the help of the creative art library p5.js, if you have further questions on the code, please let me know in the comments!

In general, you start by just clicking the “Add a circle” button on the right control panel.

The circle you just created will now spin around the 1st circle with the given attributes, to change these, just click onto the circle’s slot on the control panel and you will see 3 parameters.

Radius – the radius of the circle. (If set to negative, you will have the circle inside of its parent-circle)

Speed – the speed of the circle by which it is going to be rotating around its parent-circle.

Angle – the angle (from its parent-circle) at which the circle will start a new round

 

In order to see some of the changes and begin a new print, you have to press the Restart button.

All circles will be removed with the Remove all button.

Save canvas gives you a .jpg image of your current print.

To remove the printer from your canvas, just uncheck “Show printer”.

 

The Speed up textbox allows you to set how often per drawing run the new frame should be generated. (higher values cause more lag on slower machines)

The Max curve textbox is used to set the maximum of curve points on the canvas. (every point has to be stored into a 2D-Array, so the more points, the longer the drawing will last.

The Presets tab is not jet supported.

 

Playing around with this system of a spirograph printer using the benice equation meant hours of fun for me, so I really hope this little coded toy could save you a rainy day.

 

Credits for the idea of such patterns go out to this guy who started the patterns using a software called geogebra.

 

When you have recommendations for the code, please feel free to write a comment or make a Github pull request.
